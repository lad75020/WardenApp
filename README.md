## ✨ Why Warden?

Most AI apps today are just websites wrapped in a window (Electron). They feel heavy, drain battery, and don't integrate well with macOS.

Warden is different. It's built with 100% native code, making it:
- **Blazing Fast**: Launches instantly, uses minimal RAM (<150MB).
- **Battery Friendly**: Optimized for Apple Silicon efficiency.
- **Truly Private**: Your data never leaves your device (except to your chosen AI provider).

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-Model Support**: Use OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Gemini, Perplexity,Oenrouter and more using your own API key.
- **Local AI**: Full support for Ollama and LM Studio.
- **Search Capabilities**: Real-time web search integration with citation support.
- **Developer Tools**: Native code execution and syntax highlighting.
- **Fluid Design**: Animations and interactions that feel right at home on your Mac, including liquid glass support for MacOS 26.
